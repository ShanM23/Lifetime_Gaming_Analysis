# Lifetime_Gaming_Analysis
## üïπ Overview

I have been an avid gamer since I was old enough to grasp a controller so it was only right that I would choose video games as the top of my very first personal project. I will be analyzing every video game I've ever played.

## Groundwork:
_**1. Defining the objective:**_ 

   To use as a video game suggestion model and discover trends in gamer preferences based on publishers, consoles, and video games itself.

_**2. Collecting the data:**_

   Excel was used to create and clean the data. I created two tables, "Video Games" and "Platforms", listing every video game that I've ever played based on memory, checking my achievements and history on consoles and accounts, and researching a few video games that I remembered gameplay details of but couldn't name.

   Designated columns detailed their respective release dates, developers, publishers, release dates, genres, and Metacritic/user scores. I then used the "Platforms" table to show which consoles each game was played on. Ran cleaning operations to remove duplicates, typos, and other errors.

_**4. Database Creation:**_

   DB Browser for SQLite was used to transform this data into a functioning database.

_**5. Analysis**_

  SQLite was used to analyze and re-verify the data by running queries.

_**6. Visualization**_

  Transferred data into Tableau to create a dynamic dashboard.
